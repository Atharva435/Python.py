## 👨‍💻 About Me

I have completed learning the **fundamentals of C programming**, which helped me build a strong foundation in:
- Logic building  
- Structured programming  
- Understanding how programs work at a low level  

Currently, I am **learning Python**, focusing on writing clean, readable code and understanding how Python is used in real-world applications, especially in AI and ML domains.

I believe in learning by practice, and most of my repositories contain hands-on programs, assignments, and small experiments.
